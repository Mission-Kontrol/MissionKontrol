      <p>
        Not to alarm you and you probably want to do this as itâ€™s one of the core features. However, we wanted to make sure you were sure.
      </p>

      <p>Making this field editable will mean that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your users will be able to edit the field</li>
        <li>Any changes will be done directly on the source data</li>
        <li>The DB will have been updated so please make sure you keep backups</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You probably should not make fields editable if:</p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They are primary or secondary keys
          </li>

          <li>
            They are fields that are calculated by your system (and so will be soon overwritten)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>If you are unsure, ask a/your developer.</b>

      <p>
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" value=""> Do not show this warning again
